## Welcome

1. Hi, we’re Q Solutions LLC. We’ve met before over at Cornerstone.js Market Terms. It’s good to meet you again and we’re really glad you’re keen on becoming an author with us.

2. Imagine creating what you want, when you want, from the comfort of your own home, making passive income whether you’re working or not. Some of our authors sell stock in their free time as a hobby, some do it to get their name out there, and some are able to make it their full time profession.

3. Becoming an author is easy and if you’ve reached this point then you’re already a member and you’ve accepted our [Cornerstone.js Market Terms](https://todo). These additional terms for authors (**‘Author Terms’**) are an extra part of the Cornerstone.js Market Terms that apply specifically to authors on the Cornerstone.js Market. You’ll need to agree to them before you can become an author. These govern the relationships, rights and obligations of authors to us and buyers using Cornerstone.js Market. You agree to put your items on Envato Market and make them available to buyers on the basis stated in the Envato Market Terms and these Author Terms.

> As an author on the Envato Market you have responsibilities to us and buyers of your items. Please take the time to review these Author Terms carefully.

4. When we say **‘you’** in these Author Terms we are referring to you, the author whose details are listed as the Cornerstone.js Market account holder. All other words defined or explained in the Cornerstone.js Market Terms have the same meaning here. If there’s any inconsistency between what we say in these Author Terms and what is in the Cornerstone.js Market Terms, what we say in these Author Terms prevails.

5. Read on for details about your author responsibilities, the process of selling your items on the Cornerstone.js Market and how you can earn money with us.
