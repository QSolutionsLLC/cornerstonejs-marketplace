## Welcome to Cornerstone.js Market

1. Hi, we’re Q Solutions and welcome! We’re happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy your stay. When we say **‘we’** , **‘us’** or **‘Q Solutions’** it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the **Cornerstone.js Market** site.

2. Q Solution's digital marketplace helps people around the world get creative and earn online. When you create an account and accept these terms you become a **member** of our community. You will have a Cornerstone.js Market account that will allow you to buy and sell items like the ones found on the Cornerstone.js Market site and make other related transactions.

3. The Cornerstone.js Market site is a platform that allows members to buy and sell licenses to use digital items like Cornerstone.js tools, image loaders, metadata providers, software code, plugins, learning materials and much, much more. On Cornerstone.js Market, buyers and authors (sellers) transact with each other directly and we provide the platform to allow the transactions to happen. Any transactions are logged on your member’s statement, which records the payments made by you to authors via Cornerstone.js Market (as a **buyer**) and by buyers via Cornerstone.js Market to you (as an **author**).

4. The items on Cornerstone.js Market are owned by the authors, not by us. The items on Cornerstone.js Market are uploaded at the direction of the author. We provide the platform services; we do not take ownership of the items.

5. During your time with us you agree to follow the ground rules outlined in these terms so please read and understand them. If you don’t accept the terms then we’ll be sad, but you will need to leave because your presence on and use of the Cornerstone.js Market site is conditional on your acceptance to be bound by these terms and the [Acceptable Use Policy](/#/legal/acceptable-use-policy") whether you become a member or not.
